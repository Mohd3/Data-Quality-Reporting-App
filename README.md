# Data-Quality-App
This is a data quality reporting application developed using Python, with the Streamlit library for the user interface.

To run the app, open the CMD and type the following command:

streamlit run (file name).py

Alternatively, you can use this link, and there's no need to install Streamlit or any dependencies:

As this app was developed for a specific type of dataset with specific features for assessment, I have created a modified version (app2) that works with any type of dataset. However, it won't provide as comprehensive data quality reporting.

Simply upload the dataset you want to assess, and that's it :)
